# 3DVS

With the files in the Docker folder it is possible to create Docker
images for 3DVS which can be run in a Linux or Windows
environment.

The repository provides three docker files to create:

Smart Factory: The model of the Smart Factory at DFKI in Kaiserslautern
	which is used in the SmartPlant One project of Open Call I.
	
BoschRexroth: An example for a simple data driven animation of an XML3D
	model. Instructions on how to animate the scene are given in
	BoschRexroth/ScriptsAndDocuments/instruction.docx .

Whirlpool: An example application for the visualization of deviation
	maps. This example was created in the context of the FITMAN
	project (http://www.fitman-fi.eu/).

generic: A generic 3DVS image which can be used for the
	 development of own applications.
	
The file ReadMe.txt in folder Docker contains further instructions on how
to create the respective docker images to create and deploy the respective
docker images with the assumption that docker (www.docker.com) is already
installed in the local environment.
